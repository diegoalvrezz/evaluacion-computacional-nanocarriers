https://mammascope-demo.streamlit.app/

The demo includes **simulated and anonymized example files** so the full workflow can be tested without using real clinical data.

# Overview

Breast cancer molecular subtyping is essential for guiding therapeutic decisions. In routine clinical practice, classification is commonly performed using **immunohistochemistry (IHC)** by evaluating biomarkers such as:

- ER (Estrogen Receptor)
- PR (Progesterone Receptor)
- HER2
- Ki-67

However, IHC presents limitations related to **inter-observer variability and subjective interpretation**, particularly for Ki-67.

The **MammaTyper® assay**, based on RT-qPCR technology, quantifies the expression of the genes:

- ESR1
- PGR
- ERBB2
- MKI67

This provides a **quantitative and reproducible molecular classification**.

This project develops a software tool that **automates the integration and comparison of results between both methods**, facilitating the analysis of diagnostic concordance.

---

# Key Features

The system provides the following functionality:

- Import of **IHC results from Excel files (PatWin)**
- Import of **MammaTyper PDF reports**
- Automatic **biomarker extraction**
- Integration of results into a structured dataset
- Identification of **concordances and discordances**
- Automatic **report generation**
- Export of processed results

The application is implemented using **Python and Streamlit**, providing a lightweight interface suitable for clinical environments.
